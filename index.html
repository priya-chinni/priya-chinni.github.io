As a seasoned Full Stack Java Developer with over 8 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in crafting robust, end-to-end enterprise applications. My background spans across designing backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate, as well as building intuitive, responsive user interfaces with frameworks like React and Angular. I bring deep proficiency in integrating RESTful services, optimizing database performance across platforms like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, and Oracle, and implementing event-driven architectures using Kafka and messaging queues. With a strong foundation in DevOps, I’ve automated build and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes on cloud platforms including AWS. I’m committed to clean code, test-driven development, and collaborative Agile delivery, consistently aligning technology with business goals.
